# westgermanic

New chronology of the West Germanic language family incorporating the latest linguistics research, including evidence from runic inscriptions and textual attestations ranging from the 3rd to 8th centuries. 

Note that the project is still in the earliest stages of work, and additions and modifications may be frequent. Conventions may change drastically as I try to find the right style. Mistakes are abundant, and I may have switched around the terms "terminus ante quem" and "terminus post quem" in some parts. 

Sections with any significant content include Chapter 2: The West Germanic Runic Inscriptions and Chapter 3: The West Germanic texts.
